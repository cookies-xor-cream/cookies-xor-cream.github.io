Fuck, it's like when you'd have too much speed,
Can't stay awake but you never caught any sleep,
Whilst our shut-eye stuck and fastened tight
In a one-hour nightmare-dream each night.

And a bullet surely gives a blackened view,
But can you aim the through-and-though?
When love-borne-fear is haunting us, like an Abrahamic truth,
It would sink in that it's permanent:

God I'd miss these backlit hues,
But I don't miss the truth.

And your gifts were clothes in leafy greens,
To race your heart through camouflage, that we had never seen,
But when cutlery is thrown at me, I assume it's well deserved,
To break the plates off which she ate, that never will be served.

The hairdresser couldn't touch my hair,
I hated it, but she didn't care,
She pulled on it, she held me fast,
With an opened cork, and empty glass in hand.

No, I loved the chef with turned-off lights,
The chopping shallots with sharpened knives,
And the accidental blood-let glides,
Fuck, now I'd let each one slide.

But I didn't mind it if my shirt
Was riddled with a dozen tears,
The lights were turned off,
And the bleeding didn't hurt.

No the bleeding didn't hurt.
