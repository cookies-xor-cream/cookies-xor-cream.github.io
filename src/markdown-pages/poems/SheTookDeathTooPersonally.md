"Do you really play just that damn deaf,
That you feign you missed what she had said?"

*"You were, maybe, good with her,
But you're shy with me and I'm eight years
Shy of rent"*

"You think you know what she would want,
But you are dumb, and blind, and spent.

Don't bargain with the things I say,
I said all that I could wish,
and all that I have gravely meant:
So look at me, but there's nothing
left to see"

She was sitting there,
All curled up in her book,
Dont look, dont look,
Dont look, dont look,

Dont look, dont look,
Dont look.

One look was all
That it would take,
If it had ever took.
