Memorypoint: Smokey Oneliners In A Flashbulb Pistol

With a shutter snap and full force flash
She flatlined her batteries.

The lithium, it couldn't hold,
The alkali had broke its mould.

A caustic spray of absentees,
That never need RSVP.

The lead paint wore its absence strung
Like fibrosis caught up in her lungs.

We wouldn't miss asbestos words,
The turns of phrase and sharpened tongues.

I was left here, with these memories
That didn't want to plug into the prise.

Then the sunlight stabbed as it must do,
Smouldered her goodbyes, and then her dues.

The only thing that was left on ice
Was her fascination with prepositions,

But especially the word "through",
When it wore the past as a disguise.

And that stuck with me
The whole damn way, straight through.
