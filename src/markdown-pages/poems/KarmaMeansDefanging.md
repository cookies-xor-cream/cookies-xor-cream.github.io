Ullapool And Bombard: Karma Means Defanging Myself

Keep me breathing,
I'll live with heaving,
I don't hate you,
I'm only grieving.

Thanks for all
The breath I drew,
And with each one
I had thought of you.

And thought that I
Should forget about
The nowheres and
The roundabout.

You knew, coz I told
You every week.
But you say you didn't,
Now I can't speak.

But that's old news,
I know it is.
I left you clues.
I knew I did.

Just pull my teeth,
And lay them bare,
With locust swarms
It might be fair.
