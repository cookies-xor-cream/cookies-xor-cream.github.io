Ketamine And A Badly Timed Swim (We Fell Off The Fucking Bridge Apparently)

I'm sat by the shore,
On the side that you fell.

You wished with a noose,
So I saw to it well.

And you slipped out your body,
I saw as you slipped.

But you dared to deny me,
As I reached for a sip.

I can hear it all dripping,
As it 'knocks' I suppose.

It came for the throne,
With the old king deposed.

And if you might live,
I can see to that too.

Aim not for your head,
But aim to shoot through.

And if you might come rise,
With a flood of the drowned.

Then take me right now,
I am ripe for the crown.

Please come with my dreams,
We'll be lost in our fate.

Well throw out the key,
As we're locking the gate.

As I'm writing the rest,
I find my pen skips.

To the waterlogged step,
Of this man as he trips.

In a double entendre,
And in double the sense.

Come here forthwith,
We can sit as we pense.

I stranded myself,
But you chose to be here.

You stranded yourself,
And you chose me my dear.
