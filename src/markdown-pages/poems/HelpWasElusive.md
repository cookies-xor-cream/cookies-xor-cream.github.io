If It Had To Be Somebody's Fault, Wouldn't It Have Been Circumstance's?
Help Was Elusive

She always muttered winged words,
That never fluttered, were never heard,
Cycloneborne a stillbirth staccato,
The reaper thought he'd take it slow
With you.

Each arythmic draw of summer breath
You feel the hate, like infanticide
But she had chose to meet this fate,
She chose the murder suicide,

Well scratch the murder,
And you'd have hurt her,
But she'd have killed you,
And that would make it true.

I never knew what to do with her,
And now I don't know what to fucking do
With you.
