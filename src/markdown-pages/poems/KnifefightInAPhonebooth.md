Nevermore Fought Dirty Then Played Her Closing Act: The 2010s In A Post 2016 World

We're a knifefight in a phonebooth
And I was begging you to end it,
But the truth isn't found in
Silty wounds.

Salt them, and I'll dust them,
Or I'll dust them off and break you,
With pocketsand and fistfuls
Of your mace.

I just need some space and figure
You might need some more,
And it had been a week since we
Had watched the door.

Don't go I'll leave and shake
All the trouble you abhor,
I'm nothing now, and you're nothing
Either anymore.

I was sitting bending breaking
And I was praying then rescinding
Every prayer to every god that
I had made.

But you licked your wounds,
And bound your bruises,
To the fixtures of these
Daylight corposes.

You opened up the door
And you slammed it shut
Right with your casket
And its gore.

And the phonebooth glass
Had shattered then,  I lay
Quarterless and distant,
By the door.

And if she had then called me,
Just yesterday, know I
Would tell the pair of you
That the pair of us,

Still would've been bored.

But the difference between the bored she was
And the bored I could've been,
Is the boring of a hole that called the
Curtains to the scene.
