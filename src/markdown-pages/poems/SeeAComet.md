Fly Higher, I'd Like To See A Comet.

It's fucking weird that I can't breath,
What's that saying that she used?
Every time that we fall asleep,
We wake up more confused?

Between the coughing fits
And the wearing down of us,
We have a while to go
And here I am waiting on the bus.

Like all that I recall
Is all I have forgot,
Like this blackhole of a life
Is all I've begot.

The days all rot and blend,
And all that you have left,
Is to swear to me that you,
Are still working on the mend.

Icarus,
You fly on waxy wings,
We know it all to well,
And I bet you do as well.
