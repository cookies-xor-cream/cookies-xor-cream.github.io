Casual Racism: Coda For The Winterscape Of Maternity Leave Ending

He's out here playing 'conjure slurs',
With his dart-set and a map,
And he can't quite rest until he's cursed,
And he's made her feel like crap.

But he cauterized the damage caused,
When the wounds he stuck had lit aflame,
And he couldn't help but take a pause,
And find a second cause to place the blame.

And I can't complain, I should (I shouldn't quite try to) do,
But I'm burnt out whole, gone through and through,
And found myself both spineless and askew.

I wish that I could split the assault
and the battery with you.

But part of me is happy, I'm the one at bay:
But I must watch you brave abusive words,
On colour, gender, and all that he can say,
And not a single quanta of any of it

Is anything remotely close to curt.

Well I', hiding behind the backlit droning,
Of PDFs clung my screen groaning,
There sleeps seas of words in eyeless scrolling,
That I won't ever see or come to read, I'm holing.

Then pastel dresses on crimson shoes?
They won't pair too well, I'll pass the truth,
Give "thumbs down"s as they are due,
Or in honesty, maybe a measure overdue.

Coz I'm zoning out, I'm slipping through,
Past the double glazed frosted windowsides,
And forgetting to rate the rosy boots,
That meet each eye as they glide right through.

Now some random woman's siting there,
And I don't know her name 'least twice as hard,
And it's tenfold worse than an empty chair,
And I'm bored but I guess that that's a start?

When she left it all got harder.
But we're under autoignition temp,
And flashpoint can't make a self starter,
I'll bite the dust, and then the bullet harder.

And find hollowpoint rounds,
Will make the winter blare
These unpleasant sounds,

They'll let the summer slither hither,
They'll let the cold air die and wither.
