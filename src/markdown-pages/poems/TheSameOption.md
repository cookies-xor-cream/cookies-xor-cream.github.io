I'm caught between charybdis and Scylla.
I'm coiled between a serpent and a snake.
She held my hand as if to ask me,
Which of these one decisions I would make.

I'm caught by tassels serpentine,
I'm coiled between a serpent and a snake.
The scarlet is wrapping around me,
And it tells me that it's only for my sake

But you have lived here so much longer
In the same time that I haven't got to live.
No break or bend can make you stronger
You're a cactus stuck inside the desert heat.

You're a reptile that feeds on desert heed,
You're the hedonism that is feeding on our greed.
