I sleep with my arms crossed
And my hands entwined,
My ulnar nerve's stretched out
Into a zero width line.

I wouldn't call it elastic,
I don't think that that's quite true,
It's less like the tire off your cars,
And more like the sole of your shoes.

But I say to myself,
Like its vulcanised truth,
That my wrists don't burn,
And my right arm doesn't shoot.

"Shooting pain? Ugh,
Wouldn't call it that really".
"Then how do you define it
Please tell me exactly".

"I sleep wrong;
Please save the talk
Hold your mouth
And tie your tongue"
