I'm stuttering at every
Stumble of a thought,
Those I Lost,
And Those I Never Found.

I doll and sit and wait at last,
Just gotta string on one more day,
With the chatter and my idle words
Of my sated clapping trap.

Hear me out, then question me,
A keynote on the rest of it,
Floating on the restless sea,
Of work and meaning that I
Never knit.

Work's almost over, I'm due a break,
We've hit the sand and woke the worm
Up from distant pasts.

We've broke the dunes and now we get
Our break as it must lay entombed
To course-correct; to meld at last.
