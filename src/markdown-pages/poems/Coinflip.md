Coin Flip Of An Exit Plan And Barbed Wire On The Slamming Door

She's the corpus of a spirit,
She's a smear of the past,
She's a hollow shell of
What she inherits at last.

She's the lack of a battle,
She's the backflow's reverse,
She's the carapace of
The finish to a quieter verse.

She's my pinch on her chin,
She's a record stood still,
I think that that's fine
But I wish she would spin.

She's a 10 minute walk,
She's a flower in wilt,
She's definitive proof
I need something to sip.

She's her eyes on my face,
She's a hiccup in time,
She's the anachronism
That we're flipping the dime.
