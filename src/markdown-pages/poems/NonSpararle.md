Non Spararle

"I don't know why all this wait,
I feel like we've stopped crossing fates"

And that final line was true:
It spoke of the destiny That we'd accrued.

"And now was overdue"
I could never live with you
"And I could never live without"
I hope the afterlife can sort this out

"Or else I might take a chance,
And end this shit by force tonight"

That anachronistic thought
Had echoed in my head,
As I had once recalled
That we're worst friends

"Of one long dead".

"A pistol speaks no love",
Since your fusillade can't hit a dove,
"You'll need bring passion"
With no heart

"To bring yourself
To bring a knife".

To bring a killing.
To a wedding.

With hell betwixt
Your sorry smile
And laden wrist
Conscript.

We'll overdose on non-prescripts.
