Crazy Talk From XRay Ribs

You came back from the doctor's,
and the discussions of your bruise,
But he didn't give you any pills,
Why'd you mention that you used?

It'd been a half year since
shedding x-ray ribs, since the
stitches had been removed.

I mentioned home in passing,
And then you were suggesting
That I moved?
