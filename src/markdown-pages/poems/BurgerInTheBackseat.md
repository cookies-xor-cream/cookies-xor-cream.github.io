Driving While Eating A Fucking Burger

The logistics of an early dinner,
And overbites will find the off-road,
Make pedestrians get a splatter slimmer,
Bar the casket, I suppose.

Y'know you've got to get some rest,
And you've got to drive when driving,
You don't stop that when you pass the test,
Coz the pedals can be surprising.

Stopping distance is quadratic with your speed,
The fastest lives will crash the hardest,
And rip your heart right off your sleeve,
All eight hours are a test and
I know that you'd attest.
