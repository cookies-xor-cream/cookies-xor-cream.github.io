The dying light of morning stuck,
Clung by chilly, smoky air,
And the pigeon and finch soundbite spells,
That died to the highway at 6am.

The daylight's breath of car-soaked fumes,
Was a single oxide shy of safe,
As each machine layed traffic-queued,
To kill the world and dig its grave anew,

The clearest sight in the streetside view.
