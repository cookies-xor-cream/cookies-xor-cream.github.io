I may be a half wit
But youre at your at your wits end
Trying to make ends meet ends,
You send for help with no reply
Guess you'll mend this shit alone tonight

I'm heavensent, we'rr broken
But you're bent by books and pages
That you nicked and have had nooked away,
And postfact claimed that she had lent
Don't lie to me luke your luck ain't spent 

This fixation on the truth,
Like an ambidextrous scream,
Screens out the words that you might mean
From those that truth would
Never have dared seen.

I mean,
If you catch my drift.

But ghosts pass through cars, don't they?
