Doctor's Office

I hate these syllabic ramblings
Of these feelgood and these speakfast feelings,
Soupy spurs of words spun long
Spun till they roll right off your tongue.

They're bled dry, and they are devoid of meaning
And anything vaguely human-seeming,
What in heaven's name is the obsession?
Hey doc, I'm done, let's call this session!
