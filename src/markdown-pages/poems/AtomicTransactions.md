Pending Atomic Transaction During An Application Of Bayes' Rule

Bayes would kill me or hand a trophy
If he saw how I had used his rule.

The instant I know something new,
Is the instant I don't think it through.

What I'm doing's a discontinuous function,
Of all the shit that's been done before.

And I've indexed you but weighted time,
So much more than I did before.
