"You have a one track mind,
Is how I'd put it I suppose.

You didn't change and never had,
So grab a drink and place it in my hand."

When she asked me I then shot a look,
And I wish that that was all it took

"Been sober the past fucking year,
And I never even got to deliver.

Wasted time and effort spent,
But I'm not broken, I'm only bent."

'Then go ahead and sleep at night,
Turn off the amber bedroom lights.'

"Word play's nice but got no place,
If I drink now I'm drunk posthaste.

There's a generational gap, you know,
But what I could've had won't let me go.

The nightmares stay, they'll never part
I need them finished for a clean slate start.

And I know you know that they're gonna stay,
I can see it written across your face."

Her skin reacts to the light like glass,
And she don't seem shattered, but that's just an act.

'The only writing's on the wall,
I may be stumbling but you're gonna fall.

Just don't come calling, stay abroad,
That's something I would applaud,

Of all the stupid choices made,
That's the only one that I'd applaud,
Or out loud, anyways.'
