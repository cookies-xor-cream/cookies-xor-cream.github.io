Red Tape Pollution In Her Time

So drag me by the wrist,
Then show me all the blue you bleed,
And warn me of the dangers,
But I will never never take your heed.

Cause I'm caught between the red tape
Of the path I'm on and want to take,
And maybe had you filed it under
Section B I'd see.

The filing cab just grew some wings,
So that we could breaks the chains,
and we could maybe set it free.

And when it flies, please don't talk to me,
Cause I'm still hazy but I'm me.

Though if I don't recall,
Please just bury me, I'm too far gone,
Im just a memory.

That's killed my brain and taken me,
So please feel free to set me free,
And let me be at peace.

Just let me be at ease, I'll be
Laying by the wayside breeze,
Of the earth's core as it spins.
And of the mantle as it shifts.

And of the surface bored
Of all the tape that
We have plagued it with.
