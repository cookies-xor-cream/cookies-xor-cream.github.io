Quest For A Few Fewer Celsius

The sky was once so cold at night,
To nip the desert heat that bites,
But I bide my time and bid farewell,
And freeze inside the searing glare.

Of all the notions I can't seem sell,
I most of all miss the ice clung air,
The sealess stare of seam-filled rocks,
That lack the water to fill the clocks.

But now I live by seaside straits,
By salty water that solely hates,
The things I need and tends to take,
The things I need,to try to break me.

From ocean view to desert streets,
That I've walked along but couldn't find
Where heaven meets this heat.
