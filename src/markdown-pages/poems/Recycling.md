I Recycled So Many Memories But You Recycled Christ

I never realised how much I recycled,
Till it was the passage of time that turned the wine sour.

It takes a stooge of a girl to cupboard it all,
And smash the sacrament wine as she opens the door.

She was missing that day, too sick to get up,
Eating spoonfuls of yoghurt, I bet poured by the cup.

And I would go call it cheating, but was wholely convinced,
That once you are holy, you stop dealing with this.
