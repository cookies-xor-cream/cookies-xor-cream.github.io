Geochemistry Of The Western States

I'm rolled up in their red tape,
And their bullshit policies,
The paranoia that they must take,
And push out onto me.

A corporate bunny roped,
A ropebunny on an underdose,
Prays for knvies as they might hope,
To get cut free and find repose.

In search for the ecology,
Of the ground they'll never dig,
That they will never see,
And never can forgive.

Freedom on this silent hill,
Is to stay tied up,
From 9 to 6 till
hereon out.

When the shrill voice
meets these icy claws,
They'll sit deposed
And then fly out of the room.

From hereon out,
As Darwin calls to Broome,
They will sleep in Adelaide,
Their resting place, their tomb.

Shoot me, I won't join the cast,
Kill me, it will set me free,
Set me free at last,
Got alt-f4 queued for 3pm.

And you'll never catch me cold,
Coz I'm burning up,
Or I'm burnt out I suppose.
