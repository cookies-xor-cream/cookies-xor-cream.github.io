Love's Thermal Vampirism

There's an absence in the heat,
That I don't feel inside the cold.

Like its shattering my teeth,
Like it bites into my bones.

And the winter here is far too cold,
Is something that I'm often told.

But the winter here is far too short,
Leaving six months for the summer scorch.

Its like I'm watching a burning live,
Seems I'm fever-struck for all my life.

And I don't know what fish I'll reel,
Leading life in the summer heat.

But I know that I can love you more,
Than the nausea stuck inside,
That is clawing at my core.

And I can't seem to explain,
Why a toasty thirty Celsius
Feels like it melts my skin away,

But I can love you so much more
Than the nausea stuck inside that is
Clawing at my core.

It grew fangs and it's stuck inside,
But I can love you, more than it bite.
