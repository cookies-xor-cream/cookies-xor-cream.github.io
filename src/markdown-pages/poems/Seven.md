Unpublished Obituary Of A Living Girl: Received By 7 With An Hour Delay

Funny number, please riddle me,
Not with words but with heavy lead.

Did you eat nine or devour him?
Punishment for the life he lead.

Funny girl go, watch bleed him dry,
Watch the red wash into the sky.

See the colour coagulate,
Then gate-keep both your collective fate.

Everything is worse when it's seven.
Everything is worse when it's overdue.
I wrote us this postmortem,
I'll let tomorrow's papers read it for you.
