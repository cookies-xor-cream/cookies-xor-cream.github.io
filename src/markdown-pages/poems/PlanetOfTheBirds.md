I'm Photosensitive And I Got Swooped

I think that I
Can't bear to watch
The fabric as it
Comes to tear.

We're always stuck
Just one heart short,
In need of double bit
Support.

The flashing lights
And sudden sounds
Don't rattle me,
My head is sound.

But it's the drinking
That lets me brave,
Through lacked circumstance
That I wholely crave.

Be it crow, or raven,
Or magpie vulture,
I ducked it and I
Flew right under.

But wagtails are
A backup plan,
For when their shit
Starts to hit the fan.

They perch upon
The lowly wall,
And pounce upon
Without their claws.

But I dodged the sutures,
I dodged the stitches,
I ducked the magpies,
These birds are bitches.
