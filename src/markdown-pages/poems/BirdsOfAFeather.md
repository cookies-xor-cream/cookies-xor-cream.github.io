The last we saw of her that night,
Was the cawing and the laughs,
Of a cigarette-wielding parrot,
trying to get into her pants

---

She was a parrot of her love,
She was the reflection found inside,
She was the sad truth that,
she held a mirrors without her doves.

She was echoes of of her tone,
That reinforced what she thought,
Further, and forevermore,
A wooden house recast in stone.

And the concrete had to grow its wings,
A tattered pair, but colourful,
And light enough to catch and scoop
the air found underneath.

She said that he was still:
Bluebottle eggs, on a buzzing lake,
But she kept talking talking talking
Talking for her sake.

Coz she was a parrot of her love,
And the dove was stuck inside,
She told her that she loved her,
But she was just looking for a light.
