Expired Postcard Glue

"So tell me all the things that you can't be,
Then I'll fill in the vacancies,
The priest goes reads it all out loud,
As we both nod without a sound.

But they're at a wedding with vacant seats,
And each one reads reserved,
Oh I guess that it was meant to be,
And it's what they deserved.

When I got the letter,
Fuck I knew the writing,
Her voice rang loud,
And the tone was biting.

So I read the thing,
And I hated liking,
The turn of phrase,
And the lack of fighting.

"Oh I know that you hate me too,
But I'm lacking the hard proof"

So my brain fills in
The missing details,
The missing risks,
And the lacked resistance.

"Can I write you more at all?
Or will you curse me till I'm sore?
But will you break out of your mold?
Or does he do as he is told?"

"I was so wrong but you are too,
So is our blood thinner than postcard glue?"
