The first is misery, that's found fermented,
It tinges sweet but with acetic hues,
You somehow miss the caustic burn,
Even when remembering equates to self-abuse.

The second is a remembrance prayer,
You know only blurs of truths raced past,
They meet the sky and fizzle thin,
You lost the metal, but kept the cast.

The third one is a vacant feeling,
Where you try it, but with quicksand rules,
Where aiming makes you miss the mark,
And struggling means you lose the heart.

And the final one: its purest form,
An uncut dose of pastimes dead,
That comes comedown-less,
And doesn't dare to spark the dread.

I think I find the disparity funny,
Like a testament to my priorities,
The following is an ordered list,
From one to four, the life I've lived.

From one to four, the past I missed:
The first one's dead,
The second moved,
I don't care for this one,
And the last one's a cartoon.
