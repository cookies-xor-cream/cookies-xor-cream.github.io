Life Here Is Like Watching The Desert Floor Try To Sew Itself Up

It's the subtle cracks in creviced stone
That's brittle, broken to its core,
That isn't filled, that sits unhoned,
That rids the structure of all its bones.

And all we're left with is the skin,
That's rocky like the desert floor.
That spans the beach unclad with sand,
That has no hands or limbs to grasp.

The desert floor needs and yearns to reach,
both the yarn or thread and the machine,
it's a shame that we cut its fingers off,
and the heat burned the needle far too soft.
