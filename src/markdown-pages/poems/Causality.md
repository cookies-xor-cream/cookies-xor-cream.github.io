You've been stunlocked all this time,
By the pictures that we took of her,
I'd like to think that I'm smarter,
Coz I gave mine all away.

She always had blood run between
The length of her, down from her jeans
And it reached up to her ghost white tees
and ran the toll of lengthened sleeves.

And honestly if I described
The clothes she wore or how she walked:
It would be blasphemously wrong,
I wouldn't know, it's been too long.

She's a murky phantom, there afloat,
A silhouette that happened to be
Drowning aboard the same boat.
But we've capsized now.

And I've sold my dreams
At discount rate,
God (don't) forbid
We meet her fate.
