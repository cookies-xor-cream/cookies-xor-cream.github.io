I Tried So Hard To Live That I Forgot To Survive

Water never meant to freeze,
I call it ice that gambled feet,
Twenty higher and it would run,
It only needs the naked sun.

To shed its roots and to unplant,
To uproot itself, to take a stand;
It just got lucky, was brought alive,
It aims to live but can't survive.
