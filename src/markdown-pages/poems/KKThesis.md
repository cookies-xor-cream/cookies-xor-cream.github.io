Denial's Inelastic. Forgetting You Know And Remembering You Don't: A Formal Disproof Of The KK Thesis

I need the fucking verbosity
To be thinking through the gravity
Of how cut up we got:
Bar the scars and scratches.

I still remember forgetting,
The scenery sliding into a wreckage,
I don't know what car you drove,
But that shit must've been expensive.

I still forget recalling
All of the shit you took to drive,
And finding it all out after,
But fuck it, you still drove okay.

And the last thing I remembered,
Was when I got reared by your car,
And now I'm still a little afraid
To help any of my friends when they park.

We were lucky to be alive throughout,
But the scales can't tip that way forever,
I suppose that it aggregates,
And your luck was only average.

Chance made us bite guesswork's bullet,
But I remember us mapping it out,
Like a single big decision graph
Of an Imperfect Information Game.

Everything else was subpar,
We knew we were a funeral,
Or maybe a wedding, apart,
From permanence or transience.

And the beta blockers
Did they ever help?
Coz I still remember
How your hands would start to shake.

I still remember your mum
When she loved me,
And when she didn't,
But I don't remember her name,

Just fucking called her 'aunty'
(I'm sorry)
